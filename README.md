👋 Welcome to my GitHub World! 🚀

Aspiring software engineer | JavaScript enthusiast 🌟 | Multilingual learner 🌐 | Guitar player 🎸

Hey there! I'm Denis, a fresh software engineering graduate eager to make my mark in the tech industry. With a passion for JavaScript and its universe, including React, Vue, and Node.js, I'm on a mission to craft exceptional web solutions that leave a lasting impression.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new languages like German and Spanish, and strumming melodies on my guitar. I also have experience with AWS, PHP, Symfony, and Java, and I'm always up for new challenges!

Let's connect and create something awesome together. Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out—I'm open to exciting opportunities and collaborations! 🚀
